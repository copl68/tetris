# Tetris
### About
This project is an adaptation of the classic game,*Tetris*. Organize different shaped pieces in a way that rows are filled up. Once rows are filled, they will disapear and you will earn points towards our final score. The number of points you get will depend on how many rows you clear at once. The pieces will lower at a constant rate, so move fast!

1 Row - 40 pts \
2 Rows - 100 pts \
3 Rows - 300 pts 
### Controls
Use the joystick to move the pieces either left, right, or down. To rotate a piece, press down on the joystick. 

### Usage
First, create the executable by using the makefile. Simply type:
```
 > make 
```
Then, to execute the code, type:
``` 
 > ./tetris
```
The default does not allow upward movement. To override this, you may type: 
```
> ./tetris up
```
